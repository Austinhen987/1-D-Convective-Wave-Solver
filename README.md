# 1-D-Convective-Wave-Solver


This code implements a 4th-order central Dispersion-Relation-Preserving (DRP) Scheme (Tam & Webb)
to solve the simple 1-D convective wave equation:


 $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$$

 Other methods including a 4th-order and 6th-order central standard FDM are compared
 
Functionally, this code is a stepping stone to a 2-D Linearized Euler Equation Solver
